1) "You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app"
What states are commonly used as global states in application?

2) "The Redux DevTools Extension shows a history of the changes to the state in your Redux store over time. This allows you to debug your applications effectively, including using powerful techniques like "time-travel debugging"."
Does it internally stores value of my store for each session I interact? And on next try it can show me the diff? Or I can check what was the states in previous session?

3)"Reducers must not do any asynchronous logic"
What means async logic in this context?
